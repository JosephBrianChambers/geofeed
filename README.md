my thoughts on https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-json-api-with-rails-5-part-one
- thanks https://github.com/andela and https://scotch.io/ !
- nice rails api boiler plate as any to get a project up and running
- solid boiler plate to scale/swap off of: versioned api, faker, rspec, pagination, serialization, token based auth
- learned about content negotiation, cool
- what is best/nice practice to decided versioned serializer when implementing content negotiation for api version?
- todo: swap in fast json serializer
- liked the exception handling to keep code simple
- nice use of helper modules
