This repo started as my progress through rails 5 api tutorial; thanks [scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-json-api-with-rails-5-part-one)! & [andela](https://github.com/andela)!

It's now boilerplate pre-packed with application logic serving as reference code. I'll eventually rip out pure boiler plate into another repo and this will become a fun side project.
